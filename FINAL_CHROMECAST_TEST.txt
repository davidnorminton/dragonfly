CHROMECAST CASTING - FINAL TEST STEPS
======================================

Your server is running on: http://192.168.7.190:1337

THE FIX:
--------
Video player now uses FULL URLs instead of relative paths.
- Before: /api/video/stream/96
- After:  http://192.168.7.190:1337/api/video/stream/96

This allows Chromecast to find your server!

STEP-BY-STEP TEST:
------------------

1. OPEN CHROME (not Safari, not Firefox - only Chrome supports casting)
   Go to: http://localhost:1337

2. CLEAR BROWSER CACHE (important!)
   Press: Ctrl + Shift + R (or Cmd + Shift + R on Mac)
   This ensures you get the new code

3. NAVIGATE TO VIDEOS
   Click "Videos" in the top menu bar

4. SELECT A MOVIE
   Click any movie in the left sidebar

5. CLICK PLAY BUTTON
   The big ▶ Play button in the hero section

6. OPEN DEVELOPER CONSOLE
   Press F12 (or Cmd + Option + I on Mac)
   Click "Console" tab

7. VERIFY FULL URL
   You should see in console:
   🎬 VideoPlayer mounted: {videoId: 96, title: "Movie Name", type: "movie"}
   📍 Video URL (full): http://192.168.7.190:1337/api/video/stream/96
   📍 This URL will be sent to Chromecast
   
   ⚠️  If you don't see "(full)" in the log, the old code is still cached!
       Press Ctrl+Shift+R to hard refresh the page

8. CAST TO CHROMECAST
   Option A: Click the Cast icon 📡 in the Chrome toolbar (top right)
   Option B: Click the Cast icon in the video player controls
   
9. SELECT YOUR CHROMECAST
   Pick your Chromecast device from the list

10. WATCH ON TV
    Video should start playing immediately!
    No black flicker, just plays!

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------

If video STILL doesn't play on Chromecast:

A) CHECK BROWSER CACHE
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
   - Or clear all cache: Chrome Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data

B) CHECK CONSOLE LOG
   Must show "Video URL (full)" not just "Video URL"
   
C) CHECK NETWORK
   - Computer and Chromecast must be on SAME WiFi
   - Test: curl http://192.168.7.190:1337/api/system/stats
   - Should return JSON, not error

D) CHECK FIREWALL
   - macOS: System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Firewall
   - Allow Python to accept incoming connections

E) CHECK SERVER LOGS
   tail -f ~/Code/dragonfly/server.log
   
   When you cast, you should see:
   "INFO: Streaming movie: Movie Name from /path/to/file"

F) TEST URL DIRECTLY
   Open: http://localhost:1337/test_url_in_browser.html
   Check if "Full URL for Chromecast" shows full URL

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
------------------
✅ Console shows full URL with IP address
✅ Video plays in browser
✅ Cast icon appears and is clickable
✅ Selecting Chromecast shows video on TV immediately
✅ No black flicker
✅ Video plays smoothly on TV

If all else fails, send me:
1. Screenshot of Chrome console (F12)
2. Output of: tail -50 ~/Code/dragonfly/server.log
3. Your Chromecast model/generation
